# Beholder HID Bot Image Builder - RPi4

Automation to create an initial Beholder HID Bot SD image for the Raspberry Pi 4.

## Hardware:
1. Obtain a Raspberry Pi 4, preferrebly one that is Revision 1.2, such as those found [here](https://www.canakit.com/official-raspberry-pi-4-desktop-kit.html?cid=usd&src=raspberrypi) or [here](https://www.amazon.com/Vilros-Raspberry-Complete-Transparent-Cooled/dp/B07VFCB192)
2. Obtain a Raspberry Pi USB Type C to USB-A cable, such as [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07214QNQX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or USB-C to USB-C
3. You'll need a SD card of at least 16GB - the more the better. With the advent of raspberry-pis being able to boot directly from SSD/USB, this can be an option too.

## Software:

- Docker
- NodeJS
- Yarn

## Building an image

The automated process will download the latest Raspberry Pi OS arm64 image and add the necessary bits to run Beholder (note that Raspios arm64 is currently in beta)

```
yarn install
yarn create-image
```

After answering the prompts, flash a SD with the image file located in ./images, Attach it to your Raspberry Pi 4 and let 'er rip.

The first boot process will take a bit of time as updates and dependencies will be installed. Once complete simply SSH into ``beholder@beholder-hid-bot-01.local`` with the default password of ```beholder```

> Note: If you've ssh'd into the Beholder before, use ```ssh-keygen -R beholder-hid-bot-01.local``` to clear the previous host key.

After the first boot the SD card can be cloned if desired.

See MANUAL.md for manual image building instructions.

# Beholder MSD

This automated install includes the updated firmware necessary to boot from a USB Mass Storage Device, however, it may require that the bootloader be updated to the stable channel prior to first boot from a USB MSD. If flashed to a SD card, the image will take care of this allowing the next boot to be from a MSD.

See https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2711_bootloader_config.md#usbmassstorageboot for more details.

[This USB 3.1 Flash Drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D7PDLXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is super convenient and gives about 1/2 the performance of a state-of-the-art SSD w/usb adapter. Making it faster than any SD card out there, but trading off sheer speed for the convience of connecting directly to the RPi without additional bulk

## Automated Image Creation

For non-interactive image creation, add an .env file with the following variables, or set these environment variables manually.

 - WPA_SSID
 - WPA_PASSPHRASE
 - RPI_HOSTNAME
 - RPI_TIMEZONE
